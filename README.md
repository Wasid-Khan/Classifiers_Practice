# Classifierss
In this project, I'm Satiating my coding libido. The following objectives are achieved comprehensively: 

1. perform on the iris dataset which has 50 samples for each of its three
classes(labels). These plots figure each class with a different color, I'm using
(purple, blue, and yellow). The reason is that its easy to remember and feels
good on my eyes.

2. Compare six SVM classifiers with polynomial kernel (kernel='poly'),
degrees [3, 5, 7], and gamma values [.3, .5] by drawing a grid of six plots
similar to the one you obtained from step 1.

3. Step 3: Compare the following six classifiers by drawing a grid of six plots
similar to the one you obtained from step 1:

4. Step 4: Compare six variations of SVM classifiers with kernels ['sigmoid', 'rfb'],
and gamma values [1e-1, 1e0, 1e2] by drawing a grid of six plots similar to the
one you obtained from step 1

5. Step 5: Compare eight variations of neural network MLP classifiers with default
alpha (1e-4), solvers ['adam', 'lbfgs'], activation ['logistic', 'relu'] and
layers [(30,30), (10,5)] by drawing a grid of eight plots similar to the one you
obtained from step 1.


The end.
